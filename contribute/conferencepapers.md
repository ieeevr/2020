## Call for Conference Papers

**IEEE VR 2020: the 27th IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces**

March 22-26, 2020, Atlanta, Georgia, USA

[http://ieeevr.org/2020/](http://ieeevr.org/2020/)

#### Important Dates

- **November 16, 2019**: Conference paper
abstracts due (REQUIRED)
- **November 23, 2019**: Conference paper submissions due
- **January 26, 2020**: Conference paper notifications of results returned to authors
- **February 9, 2020**: Camera-ready material due from authors of accepted conference papers

#### Overview

IEEE
 VR 2020 seeks original, high-quality papers in all areas related to 
virtual reality (VR), including augmented reality (AR), mixed reality 
(MR), and 3D user interfaces (3DUIs).

For inquiries, contact: conferencepapers2020 [at] [ieeevr.org](http://ieeevr.org)

#### Submission Guidelines

Each
 research paper should be a validated contribution covering one or more 
of four styles of papers methodological, technology, applications, or 
systems. Papers are welcome that provide contributions
 in more than one of these areas. Authors should select a primary 
designation for submissions:

- **Methodological papers**
 should describe advances in theories and methods of AR/VR/MR and 3DUI, 
such as ethical issues, theories on presence, or human factors.
- **Technology papers**
 should describe advancements in algorithms or devices critical to 
AR/VR/MR and 3DUI development such as input, display, user interaction,
 or tracking.
- **Application papers**
 provide an important insight to the community by explaining how the 
authors built upon existing ideas and applied them to solve an 
interesting
 problem in a novel way. Each paper should include an evaluation of the 
success of the use of AR/VR/MR and 3DUI in the given application domain.
- **System papers**
 should indicate how the developers integrated techniques and 
technologies to produce an effective system, and convey any lessons 
learned in
 the process.

Each
 paper should include an evaluation of its contributions appropriate to 
its type (e.g., user study, case study, expert user feedback, system 
comparisons, technical benchmarking).

We welcome paper submissions between 4 and 8 pages,
**NOT including** references. Note that there are no distinct 
categories for short papers or technotes. The contribution of the paper 
will be weighed against its length during review. All submissions will 
receive at least three reviews by experts in the
 field to ensure quality of accepted submissions. All accepted 
submissions must be presented orally at the conference. Conference 
Papers will appear in the Proceedings of IEEE VR and be archived in the 
IEEE Xplore Digital Library. Starting from 2018 the Conference
 Paper track is distinct from the Journal Paper track.

Authors
 are asked to identify one or more broad topic areas for each 
submission. It is understood that these topic areas overlap, and authors
 should identify primary and, if necessary, secondary broad
 topic areas (#1, #2 or #3 below) by priority within the submission 
system. Authors should note that the conference paper chairs will use 
this information only to assist with assigning the most appropriate 
reviewers while also balancing reviewer workload. Reviewers
 will also indicate similar broad topic area priorities based on their 
expertise. There is no quota for the number of accepted submissions per 
topic area, and the overall program will be based on the highest quality
 contributions to the field as judged across
 all topics.

#### Additional Submission Guidelines

All paper submissions must be in English.
All IEEE VR Conference Paper submissions must be prepared in IEEE Computer Society VGTC format ([http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Tasks/camera.html](http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Tasks/camera.html))
 and submitted in PDF format. We
_highly _encourage authors to use the LaTeX template. However, 
authors who choose to use the MS Word template should ensure that the 
PDF submission matches the PDF format template ([http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Templates/october2017/vgtc_conference_latex.pdf](http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Templates/october2017/vgtc_conference_latex.pdf)).

**Failure to make reasonable attempts to adhere to the formatting guidelines will result in desk rejection.**

Paper
 submissions must not have been previously published. A manuscript is 
considered to have been previously published if it has appeared in 
peer-reviewed journals, magazines, books, or meeting proceedings
 that are permanently available afterward in print or electronic form to
 non-attendees, regardless of the publication language. A prior 2-page 
abstract is not considered a previous publication and therefore would 
not prohibit acceptance.

A 
paper identical or substantially similar in content (in its entirety or 
in part) to one submitted to VR must not be simultaneously under 
consideration for another conference or journal during any part
 of the VR review process, from the submission deadline until 
notifications of decisions are emailed to authors. A concurrent 2-page 
abstract under review elsewhere is not considered a simultaneous 
publication and therefore would not prohibit acceptance. 

**Failure
 to adhere to the previous or simultaneous submission guidelines will 
result in a rejection without returning the reviews.**

IEEE 
VR uses a DOUBLE-BLIND review process. This means that both the authors 
and the reviewers should remain anonymous to each other. Submissions (**including citations and optional videos**)
 should
 not contain information that identifies the authors, their 
institutions, funding sources, or their places of work. Relevant 
previous work by the authors should be cited in the third person to 
preserve anonymity. Authors should work diligently to ensure that
 their submissions do not expose their identities either through 
carelessness or intentionality. Authors that have questions/issues 
around double-blind submission policy should contact the program 
chairs. 

**Failure to make reasonable attempts to anonymize your submission will result in desk rejection.**

In 
order to fully explain the relationship between the submitted paper and 
relevant previous work by the authors, authors may additionally upload 
previous papers as well as a non-anonymous letter of explanation;
 these materials will only be seen by the primary reviewer.

Authors
 are encouraged to submit videos to aid the program committee in 
reviewing their submissions. Videos should be submitted as additional 
material in the PCS submission system along with the paper
 submission. Videos submitted with papers will automatically be 
considered for possible inclusion in the video proceedings (video 
submissions may also be made independently, as described in the separate
 Call for Videos). Videos must be free of any identifying
 information prior to reviewing as per the double-blind submission 
policy. If accepted for the video proceedings, a revised version of the 
materials will be requested.

#### Submission Deadlines

Each
 deadline is 23:59:59 AoE (Anywhere on Earth) == GMT/UTC-12:00 on the 
stated day, no matter where the submitter is located. A convenient tool 
to see when AoE is for your local time is setting the
 "Location 1" field to your location and "Location 2" to Baker Island 
(which uses AoE) at
