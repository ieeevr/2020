* Camera ready - February 14, 2020


Virtual reality has finally become a mainstream technology. Recent advances in commercial VR hardware have led to high-resolution, ergonomic, – and critically – low cost head-mounted displays. Advances in commercial input devices and interaction techniques have arguably not kept pace with advances in displays. For instance, most HMDs include a tracked input device: “wands” that are not dissimilar to the earliest examples of 3D controllers used in the VR systems of the 1980s. Interaction in commercial VR systems has similarly lagged; despite many advances in 3D interaction in the past three decades of VR research, interaction in commercial systems largely relies on classical techniques like the virtual hand, or ray-casting. This full-day workshop will bring together researchers and industry practitioners to discuss and experience the future of input devices for VR, AR, and 3D User Interfaces, and help chart a course for the future of 3D interaction techniques. In addition to a presentation at the workshop authors of all accepted submissions will be strongly encouraged to demonstrate their novel input device and interaction techniques in an interactive demo format following presentations.

## VHCIE: Workshop on Virtual Humans and Crowds in Immersive Environments
 
**Date:** March 22nd, 1:30PM-5:00PM

**Website:** [https://sites.google.com/view/vhcieieeevr2020/home](https://sites.google.com/view/vhcieieeevr2020/home)

Recently many tools, including algorithms and systems, have made it easier to populate immersive virtual environments (VEs) with autonomous characters. Today it is common to explore virtual environments that can reach the size of an entire city that can be populated by many thousands of virtual characters. Through both invited and contributed presentations, we will:
* Present state of the art character and crowd animation techniques for interactive characters. Recent developments in character animation as well as crowd animation has impressively improved the level of quality for motions, as well as computational performances. One objective of the workshop is to present how VR and immersive environments can benefit from these recent developments.
* Present some examples of new research opportunities by the availability of populated virtual environment. Populating VEs with several autonomous characters is a relatively recent advancement. What research can benefit from such capability? Our call for contributions to the workshop will explore this question. We see possibilities for socio-psychology research on crowd behaviors or treatment of social phobia. We expect presentations related to how recent technological progresses enable or facilitated such research.
* Present new research on avatars. The user is able to move and interact with virtual humans but what is the best way to represent the user to improve its experience in the virtual environment?
* Discuss technological requirements for future applications. Recent technologies and software have clearly eased the creation of populated immersive VEs. One final objective of the workshop is to gather the requirements of current users of these technologies for future applications. Do they expect better animation quality? Better rendering? Or, higher level of autonomy? What kind interactivity is expected with autonomous characters?

## ANIVAE: 3rd Annual Workshop on Animation in Virtual and Augmented Environments 

**Date:** March 22nd, 9:00AM-12:00PM

**Website:** [https://anivae.fhstp.ac.at/](https://anivae.fhstp.ac.at/)
* Submission - January 15, 2020
* Notification - January 31, 2020
* Camera ready - February 10, 2020

The overall goal of the workshop is to identify the chances and challenges of animated
content in AVR environments. It focuses on application-oriented contexts, such as industry,
education, health or architecture, creating direct benefits for end users and/or customers.
The workshops aims to create an open environment, connecting specialists from various
digital humanities research areas, such as animation, games and media studies with experts
from both vision oriented computer science such as computer graphics or information
visualization, as well as experts from technically-oriented computer science areas such as
data integration, internet-of-things or smart automation. By encouraging synergies of interdisciplinary approaches the workshop maps animation within the AVR context from different angles and creates new knowledge in this research field.

## SEARIS: 13th Annual Workshop on Software Engineering and Architectures for Realtime Interactive Systems 

**Date:** March 22nd, 9:00AM-12:00PM

**Website:** <https://www.searis.net/>
* Abstract Submission - January 31, 2020
* Notification of Presentation - February 3, 2020

SEARIS provides a forum for researchers and practitioners working on the design, development,
and support of realtime interactive systems (RIS). These systems span from Virtual Reality (VR),
Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR) environments to novel Human-Computer
Interaction systems (such as multimodal or multitouch architectures) and entertainment
applications in general. Their common principle is a strong user centric orientation which
requires real-time processing of simulation aspects as well as input/output events according to
perceptual constraints. Therefore, we encourage researchers and developers of real-time
human computer interaction systems of all flavors to share their experiences and learn from
each other during this workshop.

## SeatedVR: Workshop on Seated Virtual Reality

**Date:** March 22nd, 9:00AM-12:00PM

Accessing VR/AR while the user is being seated is not uncommon. However, sitting often is not recognized as a unique characteristic and instead is somehow addressed in the background, or it is perceived as just given, because it often also is not a design decision to make, and thus does not generate attention. Furthermore, whenever being seated really is a choosable option, it might look only limiting at first glance, but reveals various opportunities at a second. In the end, the reason for being seated are diverse and could be dictated by the surrounding real-world environment, beneficial for long term usage and ergonomics, necessary due to impairment, matching the simulated real-world activity, laziness, convenience.
However, the impact and questions on the UI design as well as the user's perception often are the same. Therefore, we think it is worth to combine research around this topic and bringing interested researchers together, to identify and discuss research and lack of such in this field. In this interactive workshop we want to tackle this agenda in lively group work and discussions, framed by short lightning talks of the accepted abstracts.

* Camera ready - February 14, 2020

Traditionally, Virtual and Augmented Reality have been conceived for purpose-built highly
instrumented laboratories. However, the commercial release of consumer grade Virtual and
Augmented Reality head-mounted displays has allowed a wider user base to experience VR and AR
in everyday environments such as their own home or work environments. If consumer VR and AR is
to evolve beyond the laboratory, a rethinking of the way we design and implement interactive VR and
AR systems for these environments application scenarios is needed.

The WEVR workshop will cover “Everyday” Virtual, Augmented and Mixed Reality research themes in all those contexts and scenarios other than research laboratories and specialist environments.
This half-day workshop will bring together researchers and industry practitioners to explore these
new challenges and define a new research agenda. We invite authors to submit 4-page position papers, preliminary research results, novel concepts or case studies (up to a maximum of 6 pages).

## SIVE: 5th Annual Workshop on Sonic Interactions in Virtual Environments


**Date:** March 22nd, 1:30PM-5:00PM

**Website:** [https://sive.create.aau.dk/](https://sive.create.aau.dk/)

Sonic interaction design is defined as the study and exploitation of sound as one of the principal channels conveying information, meaning, and aesthetic/emotional qualities in interactive contexts. This field lies at the intersection of interaction design and sound and music computing.
In the virtual reality community, the focus on research in topics related to auditory feedback has been rather limited when compared, for example, to the focus placed on visual feedback or even on haptic feedback.However, in communities such as the film community or the product sound design community it is well known that sound is a powerful way to communicate meaning and emotion to a scene or a product.

The main goal of this workshop is to increase among the virtual reality community the awareness of the importance of sonic elements when designing virtual/augmented/mixed reality environments (XR hereafter). We will also discuss how research in other related fields such as film sound theory, product sound design, sound and music computing, game sound design and computer music can inform designers of XR environments. Moreover, the workshop will feature state of the art research on the field of sound for XR environments.

K-12+ (K-12 and higher ed) education is currently undergoing a technological revolution creating
opportunities for Virtual-, Augmented-, and Mixed-Reality based learning (hereafter referred to
as XR (extended reality) technologies. Technology integration will continue to increase as
mobile devices penetrate all socioeconomic strata, and as XR technologies become affordable
to schools, vocational education providers, universities, and informal educational settings.
These technologies have the potential to facilitate effective learning by: developing the ability to
engage students of all ages with interactive 3D simulations of real-life and artificial phenomena;
presenting information that is spatially- and temporally- integrated with real objects; leveraging
whole-body motions to depict and reinforce learning content. However, there are many
questions about the integration of such experiences into the classroom, such as: What
curriculum topics might be addressed through XR technologies?; What socio-cultural,
psychological and physiological mechanisms underlie embodied cognition?; How can we design
experiences that are appropriate for the different stages of human development?; How will
pedagogical approaches be influenced by such technologies?

In this workshop we aim to bring together educators, developers and researchers who are
interested in creating and deploying XR technologies for the educational contexts of the future.
The workshop will enable participants to discuss and engage with different approaches for
designing and integrating XR technologies with a specific focus on the challenges and potential
for embodied learning in the classroom for K-12, vocational and higher education.

Cybersickness remains one of the most significant challenges facing the virtual reality industry. Although immersive technologies have been advancing rapidly, their rate of public adoption has been slowed by the fact that many users experience physical discomfort during or after the use of VR devices, with symptomatic characteristics similar to motion sickness. Furthermore, studies have consistently shown that motion sickness disproportionately affects women, and concerns have been raised about the existence of inequitable barriers for engaging with immersive media.

The Workshop on Immersive Sickness Prevention is intended to foster discussion between researchers, developers, and practitioners interested in addressing one of the most significant usability issues in the virtual reality field. We are soliciting primary research papers (4-8 pages) describing studies, novel interaction techniques, or technological interventions aimed towards understanding and mitigating cybersickness for users of immersive systems. We also welcome position papers (up to 2 pages) describing early-stage concepts, preliminary results, or case studies from industry.

## VR in VR: Workshop on Virtual Conferencing

In recent years, academic and non-academic communities are taking the climate impact of flying more seriously, from the anti-flying movement known as "flight shame" - or flygskam in Swedish, where the movement began - to the "flying less" movement in academia ([https://academicflyingblog.wordpress.com](https://academicflyingblog.wordpress.com)). Travel for academic conferences has an impact on the environment and also prevents access for certain groups.

The VR community is well placed to take a lead in developing alternatives to the face to the conference because our community has a long history of implementing and evaluating key pieces of collaborative technology that might facilitate new types of online meeting. It is perhaps time to 'eat our own dogfood' and start to plan a substantive future for the IEEE VR Conference that is online.

With VR technology we can reduce flying by supporting virtual conferencing, from pure virtual conferences to remote attendance at physical conferences to providing the glue that supports multi-site events.  Beyond climate impact, remote and distributed conferences offer the potential for many more people to get the benefits of attending academic conferences they would not otherwise have access to, due to personal, financial or political constraints.
