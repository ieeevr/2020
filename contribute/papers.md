## Call for VR Journal Papers & VR Conference Papers

**IEEE VR 2020: the 27th IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces**

March 22-26, 2020, Atlanta, Georgia, USA

[http://ieeevr.org/2020/](http://ieeevr.org/2020/)

#### Important Dates

As described below, IEEE VR 2020 features two categories of submissions: (i)
**VR Journal Papers** (appearing as a special issue of IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics), and (ii)
**VR Conference Papers**. Highlights of the submission deadlines for each category are as follows:

- September 3, 2019: **VR Journal Papers** abstracts due (REQUIRED)
- September 10, 2019: **VR Journal Papers** submissions due
- November 9, 2019: **VR Journal Papers** notification of results of first review cycle


- November 16, 2019: **VR Conference Papers** abstracts due (REQUIRED)
- November 23, 2019: **VR Conference Papers** submissions due

 

Further details about the submission deadlines can be found in the
[Call for VR Journal Papers](http://ieeevr.org/2020/contribute/journalpapers.html)
 and [Call for VR Conference Papers](http://ieeevr.org/2020/contribute/conferencepapers.html).

#### Overview

Since
 1993, the IEEE Virtual Reality conference has been the premier 
international venue for the presentation of research
 results in the broad area of virtual reality (VR). Similarly, the IEEE 
Symposium on 3D User Interfaces (3DUI), which started as a workshop at 
IEEE VR in 2004, has become the premier venue for 3D user interfaces and
 3D interaction in VR environments.

As of 2018, VR and 3DUI have been merged into a single
**IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces**, with the short name
**IEEE VR**. As such, there will not be a separate 3DUI event. 
Instead IEEE VR will encompass all of the great work in the areas of VR,
 AR, MR, and 3DUIs in parallel sessions. The conference is expected to 
feature a very full program of research paper presentations
 and posters, as well as panels, workshops, tutorials, and keynotes.

#### Submission Categories

Furthermore, as introduced in IEEE VR 2019, IEEE VR 2020 features two categories of submission: (i)
**VR Journal Papers**, and (ii) **VR Conference Papers**. Both categories have their own program committees, submission processes, and review processes.

The Program Committee will not convert VR Journal Papers directly to VR Conference Papers.

Further details about the two submission categories:

- **VR Journal Papers (to be published in the TVCG journal):** Submissions
 to this category should be a maximum of 9 pages in length, plus 2 pages of references, and should contain substantial scientific 
contributions to the field of VR and 3D user interfaces, and when 
appropriate provide complete and substantial support for results and 
conclusions. All accepted VR Journal Papers submissions will
 automatically be published in a special issue of IEEE Transactions on 
Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG). All accepted VR Journal 
Papers submissions will also include an oral presentation at IEEE VR.
- **VR Conference Papers (to be published in conference proceedings):**
 Submissions to this category should be 4–8 pages in length,
 NOT including references, and would typically reflect a more narrow 
(yet still significant) scope of contribution than VR Journal Papers. VR
 Conference Papers are not expected to cover all aspects of a typical 
journal article, such as a broad and complete
 discussion and description of related work, the design and 
implementation processes, or an evaluation. Instead they may cover one 
or two specific areas in depth, or relatively early work. The submission
 deadline for VR Conference Papers will be after the notification
 for VR Journal Papers submissions. All accepted VR Conference Papers 
will appear in the archival proceedings of the IEEE Virtual Reality 2020
 Conference, continuing the highly successful legacy of IEEE Xplore 
Digital Library papers under the IEEE Virtual Reality
 2020 brand name, and all accepted VR Conference Papers submissions will
 also include an oral presentation at IEEE VR.

**NOTE:**
 Authors should carefully
 consider which category is appropriate for their submission. There will
 be no programmatic path from VR Journal Papers to VR Conference Papers.
 In other words,
**the VR Journal Papers reviewers will NOT be allowed to convert a VR 
Journal Papers submission to a VR Conference Papers submission**. Any resubmission of a VR Journal Papers submission to VR Conference Papers is a decision that will have to be made by
 the authors.

The Call for VR Journal Papers and VR Conference Papers can be found here:

Call for Posters, Panels, Tutorials, and Workshops will be issued separately.
