## Slide Preparation

In order to take advantage of the widescreen projectors, you will need to create your slides using a widescreen aspect ratio. Please note that this is not mandatory, but if you choose to use a traditional 4:3 aspect ratio, then your slides will appear "pillar boxed."

For your convenience we have prepared an optional <strong>[presentation template](../docs/vr-2020-template.pptx)</strong>.
