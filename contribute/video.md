## Call for Videos
**IEEE VR 2020: the 27th IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces**

March 22nd - 26th, 2020, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.
[http://ieeevr.org/2020/](http://ieeevr.org/2020/)
#### Important Dates
- **December 7, 2019**: Submission deadline

#### Overview
We invite VR researchers and enthusiasts to submit videos showcasing virtual reality research, applications, and other creative work. Video submissions may also include 3D user interfaces, mixed reality, or augmented reality. We are proud to continue last yearâ€™s two video submission tracks: Technical Video and Creative VR. Accepted video submissions will be featured on the IEEE Virtual Reality Conference [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/ieeevrconf).

#### Creative VR Track
Submissions to the Creative VR track should be artistic, creative, experimental, narrative, or journalistic in nature and produced in a 360-degree spherical format. Audio-visual immersion and user participation have the potential to heighten a viewer's sense of presence and level of engagement with a presentation form that is closer to how we actually perceive and engage with the world around us. We are interested in originality and innovation in the design of immersive experiences. Video submissions in this track should be limited from 3 to 8 minutes in length and adhere to the additional specifications outlined below. Your video should also include a title slide at its beginning detailing the title, authors, and affiliations (similar to a typical presentation title slide).

#### Technical Video Track
Submissions to the Technical Video Track should be videos with intent to demonstrate preliminary results, consolidated researched results, works-in-progress, and research/technical demonstrations. We also invite video demos of creative VR experiences that have been documented and produced as a framed standard video. Technical video submissions should be limited to 2 to 5 minutes in length and comply with the specification outlined below.  Your video should also include a title slide at its beginning detailing the title, authors, and affiliations (similar to a typical presentation title slide). Videos submitted in this category should be able to stand on their own, adequately present their topic, and be narrated in English. Submitters should be aware that selected videos will be included in the electronic proceedings and will also be prominently displayed during the IEEE Virtual Reality conference.

__Special announcement to authors with videos related to their paper/poster submissions:__  Please be advised that although you may have uploaded your video content along with your submission through the process outlined through PCS; <u>for any video content to be considered for either of these tracks, they must be submitted again separately through the process outlined within this call</u>.

#### Video Submission Specifications
When preparing the video, please make it as professional as possible. Producing a video already requires a significant amount of effort, and spending just a little more effort to raise the quality can make a big difference. Submitted videos should follow the following guidelines:
#### Technical Video Track
- Length: 2 to 5 minutes.
- Standard framed HD video format.
- <u>Your video will need to be submitted via a Youtube URL link.</u>
- Titles and credits should not be displayed more than ten seconds: the content is the most important!
- Please follow the YouTube recommended encoding settings (for frame rate and bitrate): [https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1722171](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1722171)
- Encode your video using square pixels for the pixel aspect ratio and disable interlacing.
- We strongly recommend 16:9 aspect ratio and resolution of at least 1280x720. High frame rate and resolutions are possible if within the YouTube recommendations.

#### Creative VR Track
- Length: 3 to 8 minutes.
- Production might be live-action, CGI omni-directional rendering, visual FX compositing, etc.
- Titles and credits should not be displayed more ten seconds: the content is the most important!
- Spherical/equirectangular 360 degree format in monoscopic or stereoscopic 3D (top-bottom layout with left on top).
- <u>Your video will need to be submitted via a YouTube link.</u>
- Use the YouTube 360 degree Video Metadata App to ensure that your video is recognized as an interactive 360 degree video: [https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6178631](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6178631)
- Aspect ratio is 2:1 for mono or 1:1 for stereoscopic 3D (top-bottom). The recommended horizontal resolution is 4k. YouTube recommends 16:9 aspect ratio, but the correct 2:1 aspect ratio for spherical projection seems to work as well and is preferred.
- Please follow the YouTube recommended encoding settings (for frame rate and bitrate): [https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1722171](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1722171)
- Spatial audio is possible within the YouTube specification (1st order ambisonic): [https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6395969](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6395969)

#### General Submission Guidelines
Each submission must contain:
- A Youtube link of their video
- A working link to a downloadable one-page PDF abstract (outlined below)
 
Each 1 page PDF abstract should include:
- A title.
- A 200-word abstract providing a description, summary, or logline for the submission.
- Contact information with author names, affiliations, and an email address for the lead author.
- A high-resolution (300 dpi) representative still image in the PDF document.
- Follows [all formatting guidelines](http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Tasks/camera.html) set by the IEEE Computer Society, as these descriptions will be included in the electronic proceedings.
