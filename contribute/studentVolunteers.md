- **February 16, 2020**: Student volunteer notification of acceptance

<br>
Dedicated and enthusiastic student volunteers (SVs) are crucial for the organization of a successful conference. Serving as a student volunteer is also a great chance to meet and interact with other scientists from the field of Virtual Reality. We look forward to receiving your application for IEEE VR 2020. 

#### Benefits

Besides the stimulating experience, SVs will receive an excellent package of benefits that includes: free registration, an extra student volunteerâ€™s social, and free housing for non-local volunteers when possible. Travel funds for SVs cannot be provided.

#### Expectations

You must be willing to work about **20 hours** during the conference. Furthermore, you must be available for SV orientation at the main venue on the afternoon of **March 21**--a day before the conference begins. If you cannot commit yourself to this time frame and this amount of work, then please do not take away a slot from another willing student.  Your SV duties will include: working the registration desk, providing assistance to speakers and attendees, checking badges for attendance, and more. In addition, this year we have introduced a new role: photography volunteer.

#### Eligibility
All full-time undergraduate and graduate students interested in Virtual Reality are eligible. We will give priority to those SVs with an accepted paper/poster presentation. In addition, we will consider geographic distance from the conference, as well as diversity in the area of research. 


#### Application

The application for student volunteers is now closed!
