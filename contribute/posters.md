#### Overview

The 27th IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces 2020 seeks poster submissions, which describe recently completed work, highly relevant results of work in progress, or successful systems and applications, in all areas related to virtual reality, including augmented reality (AR), mixed reality (MR), and 3D user interfaces.

Presenting a poster is a great way to get feedback on work that has not yet been published. Poster presentations will be an integral part of the conference, with sessions for interactive discussion between presenters and attendees for at least two days, plus a fast-forward presentation track where authors can orally present a brief summary of their work to all conference attendees. Note that, in order to maintain interactive and exciting poster presentations, we require at least one presenter per accepted poster to attend the conference.


#### Submission Guidelines

Poster submissions must be in English and anonymous. The submission must be in the form of a two-page summary paper with a maximum 100-word abstract. Supplemental material, such as a poster draft or videos may be submitted as well, but are not mandatory. All submitted materials must be in PDF format with embedded fonts. Two-page paper will be included in the proceedings and will be archived in the IEEE Digital Library, and therefore must be formatted using the IEEE Computer Society format described at [http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Tasks/camera.html](http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Tasks/camera.html). Poster papers must be submitted through a special poster slot available at the online submission site - [https://new.precisionconference.com/submissions](https://new.precisionconference.com/submissions). Supplemental materials can be uploaded to the submission site as well. Poster drafts and final posters should be in portrait format with a maximum size given by the A0 standard (841 x 1189 mm; or 33.1 x 46.8 in). This year, every accepted poster would submit a 30-second teaser video.  This video would not have sound, but would have captions.
