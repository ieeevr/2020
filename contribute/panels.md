# **Call for Panels**

***IEEE VR 2020: the 27th IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces***<br>
March 22-26, 2020, Georgia, USA<br>
[http://ieeevr.org/2020/](http://ieeevr.org/2020/)

### Important Dates

* **November 19th, 2019**: Panel submissions due
* **December 2nd, 2019**: Notification

### Overview

IEEE VR 2020 seeks proposals for interactive panels. We will host three to five panels at the conference on topics drawn from academic, industrial, or consumer interests in virtual reality, augmented reality, and mixed reality. Panels are intended to generate lively discussions incorporating differing points of view around significant, emergent, or controversial topics. Panel sessions should not be structured as a series of individual, stand-alone presentations, but rather should include different perspectives on thought-provoking topics that are presented in an engaging manner. Panels should not be used to present a commercial product, nor be limited to the views of one individual. The goal should be to involve and engage all panel participants and the audience. Interested parties are invited to submit proposals for IEEE VR 2020 panels.

### Format of Panels and Panel Proposals

Panel sessions are expected to be 90 minutes long and we encourage proposers to plan for your panelists’ presentations/introductory remarks to take less than 30 minutes of that time. It is greatly preferable that the speakers each address a different aspect of the topic. Panelists should come from multiple organizations and ideally with different options from a variety of backgrounds, experience, culture, etc. in order to present varied opinions on the topic. We also suggest that your panel has a moderator who is not one of the panelists and who will introduce the panel, serve as session chair, and, if a question is not forthcoming from the audience, start off the discussion with an initial question. The panel organizer does not need to be the moderator; the organizer can be a member of the panel (or not). You do not need to have identified a moderator before submitting your proposal. The Panels Chairs can help you find a moderator if your panel is selected for VR2020.

Panel proposals should be submitted electronically and should include:

* A title for the panel session
* A brief description of : the overall topic, the issues to be discussed,  the list of thought-provoking questions to ask panelists or areas panelists will focus on in the initial discussion, their relevance and significance for the VR community (500 words or less).
* The names, contact information, and short (100 words or less) biographies for the organizer(s) and each panelist.

Submission Details and Procedure

Panel submissions must be submitted via email to the Panels Chairs. The deadline for panel submissions is: Tuesday, November 19th, 2019. The notifications will be sent by: Monday, December 2nd, 2019.
