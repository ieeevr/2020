How do I communicate accessibility needs to IEEE VR 2020 organizers?
Attendees are encouraged to mention any requests for special accommodations upon registration for the conference. If you have any questions or concerns about accessibility, or any requests for accommodation (such as ASL translation, captioning, etc.), please contact the conference accessibility chairs at accessibility2020@ieeevr.org, and they will work with you to address your concerns. Note that some requests may require advance notice, so please submit accessibility requests as far in advance of the conference date as possible in order to give us adequate time to prepare.
