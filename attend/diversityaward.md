# IEEE VR financial support for attendance: Diversity awards 

Diversity in IEEE VR participation is important. Hence, we invite interested individuals to apply for a diversity award that caters to early-career researchers, especially graduate students and early-stage postgraduates, from under-represented or historically marginalized groups. This may include, but is not exclusive to, women and persons of color, transgender and/or non-binary individuals, and applicants from developing countries.
The award consists of:

* a lunchbox networking event on March 24th, where grant recipients will informally present their research and have the opportunity to connect with each other; 
* reduced conference registration rates (early registration pricing); 
* $500 towards compensating travel and accommodation costs.

All applicants are asked to submit a one-page motivation statement that details the following: 
1. how their participation aligns with the objectives of increasing diversity in IEEE VR,
2. the impact that attending IEEE VR 2020 will have on their career, and
3. their expected contribution to the conference.

All applications will be reviewed by an independent committee with no conflict of interest with the applicants. The committee will consist of at least one member of the steering committee of IEEE VR and members of the Diversity, Accessibility, and Inclusion committee.
Please send your application to [accessibility2020@ieeevr.org](mailto:accessibility2020@ieeevr.org) by March 4th. 

Successful applicants will be notified by March 6th.
